Installing Angular CLI
Major versions of Angular CLI follow the supported major version of Angular, but minor versions can be released separately.

Install the CLI using the npm package manager:
npm install -g @angular/cli


Basic workflow:

Invoke the tool on the command line through the ng executable. Online help is available on the command line. Enter the following to list commands or options for a given command (such as generate) with a short description.

ng help
ng generate --help

To create, build, and serve a new, basic Angular project on a development server, go to the parent directory of your new workspace use the following commands:

ng new my-first-project
cd my-first-project
ng serve

In your browser, open http://localhost:4200/ to see the new application run. When you use the ng serve command to build an application and serve it locally, the server automatically rebuilds the application and reloads the page when you change any of the source files.
